What is a data acquisition system? (DAQ System)
Without data, we cannot understand how our systems are performing.
This video explains the ins and outs of a Data Acquisition System,
and why industries need this vital monitoring tool to understand,
correct and improve its processes.
As discussed already, DAQ or Data Acquisition comprises a measurement system
and a computer that can measure electrical or physical properties and record
them for further analysis. 
The concept of DAQ was introduced in 1963 where it mainly revolved around
monitoring or controlling a physical entity with software. IBM was the first
to announce a computer that was solely made for data acquisition tasks
called the IBM 7700 Data Acquisition system.  
The IBM 7700 was replaced with a more powerful IBM 1800 Data Acquisition
and Control System in 1964. With the progress in technology,
the computing capabilities have drastically changed today,
allowing us to quickly process and store data in numerous ways. 
DAQ systems are an excellent example of this.
These devices are capable of capturing data from an actual system
and store that data in an easily retrievable format for further
engineering or scientific review.  
Considering the intuitiveness of the DAQ systems, these computer-based
measurement systems are of critical importance in a variety of
verticals that need precision, such as construction, electronics,
production, and manufacturing to name a few.
